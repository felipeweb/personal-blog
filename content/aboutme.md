title: About Me
---

I am Felipe Paes de Oliveira, 28, married, and physically challenged. <br>
I love technology and people and that's why I founded [Funccloud](https://funccloud.com), an IT consultancy whose mission is to help they thrive through technology.<br>
In my spare time I love spending time with my family, going out to restaurants and learning new things.<br>
My life mission is to inspire and motivate people with my story by provoking motivation and overcoming and being happy with the prosperity of others. <br>
To live intensely all my roles in life always with joy and God's guidance. <br>
To preserve my family by respecting, loving, tolerating and understanding each other's differences.<br>
To fight for a more inclusive world where people with disabilities can have the same opportunities as anyone else, have a voice to make their own decisions, assume strategic positions in large companies, and have their freedom without any kind of judgment.
